"""This module contains notes related to algorithms designed to
search for a pattern within a large text string.



- a string is a sequence of characters over some alphabet.
Some example alphabets are binary, decimal, ASCII, UNICODE, and DNA
- Some applications for pattern matching algorithms include:
    - Parsers
    - Lexis/Nexis
    - Spam filters
    - Virus scanning
    - Digital libraries
    - Screen scrapers
    - Word processors
    - Web search engines
    - Sybmol manipulation
    - Bibliographic retrieval
    - Natrual language processing
    - Carnivore surveiallance system
    - Computational molecular biology
    - Feature detection in digitized images
