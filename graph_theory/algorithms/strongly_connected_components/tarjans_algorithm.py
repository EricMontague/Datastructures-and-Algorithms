"""This module contains my implementation of Tarjan's Strongly Connected 
Components algorithm.

A directed graph is strongly connected if you can reach each vertex in the 
graph from all other vertices in the graph. The strongly connected components
of a directed graph form a partition into subgraphs that themselves are strongly 
connected (Wikipedia).

Another way to think of this is that SCCs are self-contained cycles within a directed 
graph where every vertex in a given cycle can reach every other vertex in the same cycle.
For each SCC in a directed graph, there is no way to find a path that leaves the component 
and comes back. Because of this property, we can be sure that each SCC is unique

Concepts for this algorithm:
- Tarjan's algorithm is based on keeping track of the start time of each node in the DFS as well
as the earliest start time of all nodes reachable from a given node including itself.
- The "earliest start time" is referred to as a node's low-link value
- Low link value: The low-link value of a node is the earliest start time of a node reachable from that 
node when doing a DFS (including itself)


Overview:

Step 1: Mark the id of each node as unvisited

Step 2: Start DFS. Upon visiting a node, record its start time. At this point a node's start time
and low-link value are the same. Also, push the node onto the 'seen' stack and corresponding set.

Step 3: On DFS callback, if the previous node is on the stack then min the current node's 
low-link value with the last node's low-link value. This allows low-link values to 
propagate throughout cycles

Step 4: After visiting all neighbors, if the current node started a connected component, then
pop nodes off of the stack that are in that component. You know that a node started a 
connected component if its start time equals its low-link value
