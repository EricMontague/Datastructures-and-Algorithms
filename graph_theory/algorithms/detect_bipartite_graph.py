"""This module contains an algorithm to detect whether a graph is Bipartite or not.

A Bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be grouped into two sets, U and V, such
that each edge connects a vertex in set U to a vertex to set V.

Another way of looking at this is that the graph is 2-colorable, meaning that given two colors, 
you can assign colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Yet another way of reasoning about this is that no vertex in either set, U or V, can share an
edge with another vertex in the same set.
